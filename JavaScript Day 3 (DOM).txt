                          The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
                          It represents the page  structure as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document.
                         Through the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage.

                        The DOM represents the structure of the HTML page, with the <body> as the root of the page content.

                         Key Concepts:

                                 Document : Represents the entire webpage (the root of the DOM tree).

                                 Nodes : The elements of the DOM tree. The most common types are:

                                 Element nodes : Represent HTML elements (e.g., <div>, <p>).

                                 Text nodes : Represent the text inside an element.

                                 Attribute nodes : Represent HTML attributes (e.g., class, id).

                                 Parent and Child Nodes : Elements can contain other elements (children), forming a hierarchy.

                         Common DOM Methods:

                                     document.getElementById(id) : Selects an element by its ID.

                                     document.getElementsByClassName(className)  : Selects elements by class name.

                                     document.querySelector(selector) :  Selects the first element matching a CSS selector.

                                     document.createElement(tagName) : Creates a new HTML element.

                                     element.appendChild(child)  : Adds a new child node to an element.

                                     element.removeChild(child)   : Removes a child node from an element.

                                     element.innertext/innerHtml : Gets or sets the HTML content inside an element.
